# Sample Hardhat Project

First Replace the ERC2O.sol file present in the contracts directory with the ERC20.sol file present in the @openzeppelin directory of nodemodules.  

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
